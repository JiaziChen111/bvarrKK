\usage{
impulse(By, smat, nstep)
}
\arguments{
\item{By}{[neq x nvar x nlag] array. neq=nvar, of course, but the first index runs over
equations. In response, the first index runs over variables, the second over
shocks (in effect, equations).}

\item{smat}{square matrix of initial shock vectors. To produce 'orthogonalized
impulse responses' it should have the property that smat'*smat=sigma, where sigma
is the Var(u(t)) matrix and u(t) is the residual vector.  One way to get such a smat
is to set smat=chol(sigma).  To get the smat corresponding to a different ordering,
use smat=chol(P*Sigma*P')*P, where P is a permutation matrix.}

\item{nstep}{number of steps}
}
\value{
nvar x neq x nstep array
